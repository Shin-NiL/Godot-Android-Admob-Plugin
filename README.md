Troubleshooting
--------------
* First of all, please make sure you're able to compile the custom build for Android without the Admob plugin, this way we can isolate the cause of the issue.

* Using logcat for Android is the best way to troubleshoot most issues. You can filter Godot only messages with logcat using the command: 
```
adb logcat -s godot
```

* Error code 3 (_ERROR_CODE_NO_FILL_) is a common issue with Admob, but out of the scope to this module. Here's the description on the API page: [ERROR_CODE_NO_FILL: The ad request was successful, but no ad was returned due to lack of ad inventory.](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/AdRequest.html#ERROR_CODE_NO_FILL)
